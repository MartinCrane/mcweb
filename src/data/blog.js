  "body": "Hello there,\n\nThis is post number one for me. I thought I would start this blog in order to talk about what I'm up to... both the projects and sounds I'm making and how I'm making them.  \n\n**number 1 - Gadesco** \n\n !!!rp!!!https://vimeo.com/156655542!!!rp!!! \n\n\nRecently, I came out with [Physical Therapy](http://iomcoi.com/), my first record under my own name. This is coming after 2 Brazos records I wrote as well, but it is such a departure from those sounds that it didn’t feel like a Brazos record. I decided to release music under my own name because I’m interested in branching out into scoring, sound design and production, and I want it all under the same roof. I did have some help on this from Ian Chang and Spencer Zahn who played with me in Brazos.\n\nThe song above is one of my favorites from this record. I wrote it almost 10 years ago in Austin, and I've made 4 or 5 recordings of it since, but I never could get it quite right. This one feels the closest, and I really love what Zachary Heinzerling did with the video. It’s funny how songs can stay with you over the years. They serve as a 3rd reference point by which to triangulate your relationship with your former self, to see just how much you’ve changed (or haven’t).\n\n**number 2 - Scoring**  \n\n2015 was also the year I started writing to picture. My first project was Hugh The Hunter, a short film by Zachary Heinzerling. That went to Sundance 2015 and is now available on [NOWNESS](https://www.nowness.com/story/hugh-the-hunter-zachary-heinzerling-hugh-hayden).\\n I spent the rest of the year finishing my record and working with Zachary and [Sweet Fern Productions](http://www.sweetfernproductions.com/) on some web docs that turned out really nicely. Check back in for what I'm up to. I've got some awesome projects in the works! \n\nMC",

Around the same time, I started to play with Javascript. 6 months later, I’m writing a blog post on a website I built from scratch about tonight’s premier of East Hell, the short film I scored through the ASCAP Composer’s Workshop at Columbia University. It's been a crazy 6 months.\n\n_East Hell_ plays tonight at Lincoln Center at 9:15. We're screening with [Program F](http://cufilmfest.com/film/program/f/). Tickets are [here](http://cufilmfest.com/film/program/f/). Director Callum Smith and I worked on the score this spring under the supervision of Alex Steyermark (listen to his podcast about movie music, [1m1](http://1m1podcast.com/). It's like going to school). Callum is a great writer, and every second of East Hell is intentional, which made it tricky to score. It took us a minute to find the right music, but I'm very happy with the results. I hope _East Hell_ goes on to get Callum the attention he deserves.\n\n![East Hell Poster](xxximagehost/east-hell.png) ![East Hell Martin Crane first score](xxximagehost/ascap4.png 'East Hell Martin Crane first score') ![martin crane ](xxximagehost/ascap1.png 'How to Let Go') This picture is the first piece of my music that other people have played. I did a crash course on extended techniques and drew up loose scores that were as much maps of an energy flow as they were specific instructions on what to play. We all went into [Reservoir Studios](http://www.reservoirstudiosnyc.com/) with [Alex Venguer](http://alexvenguer.com/) to record with players from the American Federation of Musicians. They were all so talented, and their input upped the sounds we got out of the instruments. You can hear the score on the work page.\n\nSo what's next? On May 23rd I'm heading to the studio to record a 30 minute album of chamber music.",
